# SotfwareRasterizer

A program that emulates the 3d processing rendering from scratch in the CPU with C++

Using assimp to import some 3d object file

# How

- Computing perspective projection
- Apply camera transformations
- Transform to screen space
- Apply a triangle scanline
- Apply a per pixel interpolation with barycentric coordinates (z corrected)
- Write everything in an array of pixels and send to GPU to draw as a simple texture
- GPU is not used at all (only to show the result)
